# Unhandled Errors and Input Validation in Express.js API

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling and input validation.  The provided code lacks proper checks for missing data, invalid input formats, and database errors, making it vulnerable to crashes and security risks.

The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides an improved version with robust error handling and input validation.

## Bug Description

The original Express.js API endpoint for creating users (`/users`) suffers from several problems:

1. **Missing Input Validation:** It doesn't check if required fields (e.g., username, password) are present in the request body.
2. **Poor Database Error Handling:**  It catches database errors but provides only a generic error message to the client, revealing little information to help with debugging.
3. **Lack of Specific Error Responses:**  It doesn't return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request for validation errors, 409 Conflict if the username already exists).

These issues make the application unstable, less informative for developers, and potentially vulnerable to attacks.

## Solution

The improved `bugSolution.js` addresses these problems by:

1. **Adding Input Validation:** Verifying if all necessary fields exist and meet requirements.
2. **Handling Database Errors Gracefully:** Providing more specific error messages to the client while logging detailed information for debugging.
3. **Returning Appropriate HTTP Status Codes:** Using status codes that accurately reflect the outcome of the request.
